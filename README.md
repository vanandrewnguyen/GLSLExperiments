# GLSLExperiments
I am learning how to write shaders, these are my different attempts to learn them! üé®üñåÔ∏è

Breakdown
-

During university break I decided to learn the basics of GLSL using Shadertoy. I've always been afraid of touching shaders because of how difficult they seem but wanted to give it a shot regardless.

My shaders feature rendering techniques of:
- Cellular Automata
- Raymarching and SDF's
- PBR Materials, i.e. reflections, refractions, absorption
- Noise generation and FBM
- Terrain generation
- Lighting Models

In combining these techniques I can procedurally model shapes using SDF's and manipulate them in simple ways using said shapes and noise. I've written shaders using these methods which construct mountains, seaside scapes, etc.
