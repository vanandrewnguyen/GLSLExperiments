# glsl_experiments
I am learning how to write shaders, these are my different attempts to learn them! 🎨🖌️

During uni break I decided to learn the basics of GLSL using Shadertoy. This continued on for a while. This page is a documentation of some notable projects and what I learnt from each experiment. 

I've learnt techniques most notably of generating noise, drawing simple shapes and ray marching. In combining these techniques I can procedurally model shapes using SDF's and manipulate them in simple ways using said shapes and noise.

Here is the page I am using to act as my visual portfolio 💻:
